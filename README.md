[![Krihelimeter](http://krihelinator.xyz/badge/nagasaki45/krihelinator)](http://krihelinator.xyz)

This project proposes an alternative to github's [trending page](http://github.com/trending), by exposing projects with highest "krihelimeter", instead of daily stars. The krihelimeter of each repository is calculated using the commits, pull requests, and issues of that project, from the past week (similarly to github's pulse page).

## Development

The only dependencies are docker and docker-compose. To start your app:

  * Generate a github token and create a `secrets` file, with your it, like this: `GITHUB_TOKEN=<your github token>`.
  * Build the docker image: `docker-compose build`.
  * Create the DB: `docker-compose run --rm web mix ecto.create`.
  * Migrate to the latest DB scheme: `docker-compose run --rm web mix ecto.create`.
  * Spin up everything `docker-compose up -d`.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

By default, the pipeline is disabled, run it with:

    docker-compose run --rm -e PIPELINE=1 web iex -S mix

Any value except `1`, or no value at all, will disable the pipeline.

## Makefile

Some tasks are automated in the `Makefile`. During development `docker-compose run --rm web <whatever>` is used a lot! However, I prefer not to automate these one-liners unless they are used by other tasks.

## Scripts

If you messed things up there are several useful scripts in `priv/scripts` with relatively self explanatory names. Run them with `docker-compose run --rm web mix run path/to/script.exs`.

## Running in production

I use `docker` and `docker-compose` in production, so make sure you have them on your server.

    # Provisioning
    scp production/docker-compose.yml server.com:/path/to/project
    scp secrets server.com:/path/to/project

    # Get ready, locally
    docker build -t user/image .
    docker push user/image

    # Remotely
    ssh server.com
    cd /path/to/project
    docker-compose pull

    # Only on first run
    docker-compose run --rm web mix ecto.create

    # Spin up the new version
    docker-compose run --rm web mix ecto.migrate
    docker-compose run --rm web mix run priv/repo/update_krihelimeter.exs  # Optionally
    docker-compose up -d
